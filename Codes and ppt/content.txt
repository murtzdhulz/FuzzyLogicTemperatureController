2.(Fuzzy Logic (FL)):
The concept of Fuzzy Logic (FL) was conceived by Lotfi Zadeh, a professor at the University of California at Berkley
FL is a form of probabilistic logic which deals with approximate results.
It incorporates a simple, rule-based IF X AND Y THEN Z approach to solving a control problem.
for eg. If water is too cold while taking a shower, you tend to move the valve towards hot water!

3.(Application of Fuzzy Logic):

FL lends itself to implementation in systems ranging from simple, small,embedded micro-controllers 
  to large, networked, multi-channel PC or control systems.

In air conditioners, dehumidification and temperature decrease goes hand in hand. However, the complex interactions
 	between user preferences, room temperature and hunidity level are very difficult to achieve mathematically. 
             FL provides a solution for the same!

FL is also used in washing machines, where the length of wash is determined by the volume of clothes and dirt.
        There was no suitable alternative to personal trial and error.

4.(Problem Description):

We are implementing a temperature controller system using fuzzy logic.
This controller can be applied to any system which we need to maintain at a particular temperature!
The Fuzzy temperature controller will make use of two parameters :
1. Constant temperature as per the requirement(Cmd). 
2. Instantaneous temperature of the system(Temp).

5.():

IF temperature IS cold THEN heat
IF temperature IS normal THEN maintain level
IF temperature IS hot THEN cool

6.(Conceptual Design):

In our implementation,  fuzzy parameters of error (command-feedback) and error-dot (rate-of-change-of-error)are modified by the 
      adjectives "negative", "zero", and "positive".

For a meaningful interpretation of the rule matrix, we use the following notations :

"N" = "negative" error or error-dot input level
"Z" = "zero" error or error-dot input level
"P" = "positive" error or error-dot input level
"H" = "Heat" output response
"-" = "No Change" to current output
"C" = "Cool" output response

7.():

A rule matrix is a 3x3 matrix.
The columns represent "negative", "zero", and "positive" "error" inputs from left to right.
The rows represent "negative", "zero", and "positive" "error-dot" input from top to bottom.

8.(Example):

case 1 eg(fig 9) call murtaza

INPUT DEGREE OF MEMBERSHIP

"error" = -1.0: "negative" = 0.5, "zero" = 0.5, "positive" = 0.0
"error-dot" = +2.5: "negative" = 0.0, "zero" = 0.5, "positive" = 0.5
 
1. If (e < 0) AND (er < 0) then Cool 0.50 & 0.00 = 0.00
2. If (e = 0) AND (er < 0) then Heat 0.50 & 0.00 = 0.00
3. If (e > 0) AND (er < 0) then Heat 0.00 & 0.00 = 0.00
4. If (e < 0) AND (er = 0) then Cool 0.50 & 0.50 = 0.50
5. If (e = 0) AND (er = 0) then No_Chng 0.50 & 0.50 = 0.50
6. If (e > 0) AND (er = 0) then Heat 0.00 & 0.50 = 0.00
7. If (e < 0) AND (er > 0) then Cool 0.50 & 0.50 = 0.50
8. If (e = 0) AND (er > 0) then Cool 0.50 & 0.50 = 0.50
9. If (e > 0) AND (er > 0) then Heat 0.00 & 0.50 = 0.00

"negative" = (R1^2 + R4^2 + R7^2 + R8^2) (Cooling) = (0.00^2 + 0.50^2 + 0.50^2 + 0.50^2)^.5 = 0.866
"zero" = (R5^2)^.5 = (0.50^2)^.5 (No Change) = 0.500
"positive" = (R2^2 + R3^2 + R6^2 + R9^2) (Heating) = (0.00^2 + 0.00^2 + 0.00^2 + 0.00^2)^.5 = 0.000

(neg_center * neg_strength + zero_center * zero_strength + pos_center * pos_strength) = OUTPUT
(neg_strength + zero_strength + pos_strength)
 
(-100 * 0.866 + 0 * 0.500 + 100 * 0.000) = -63.4% (cooling)
(0.866 + 0.500 + 0.000)
